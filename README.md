# Crypto-Desktop-App 
This was my first try developing a desktop app with the help of electron.js.
About the project :-
1. It is using an API to fetch latest data about bitcoins.
2. It takes an input as to set an amount of bitcoin and if the actual amount exceeds it, 
   the desktop app will give a floating notification.
   
Concepts it cleared :
1. Difference between main and renderer process.
2. Different modules like shell module , browserWindow module , path , url and remote module.
3. Axios module for http calls etc.
4. ipc.main and ipc.renderer
5. Notification pop-ups.
